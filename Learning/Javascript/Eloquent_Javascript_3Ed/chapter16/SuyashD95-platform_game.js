 * Chapter 16 - Project: A Platform Game (6/3/2020)
 *
 * The Game
 * --------
 *
 * The player can walk around with the left and right arrow keys and can jump with the up arrow. 
 * Jumping is a specialty of this game character. It can reach several times its own height and 
 * can change direction in midair. This may not be entirely realistic, but it helps give the player 
 * the feeling of being in direct control of the on-screen avatar.
 * 
 * The game consists of a static background, laid out like a grid, with the moving elements overlaid on 
 * that background. Each field on the grid is either empty, solid, or lava. The moving elements are 
 * the player, coins, and certain pieces of lava. 
 * 
 * The positions of these elements are not constrained to the grid—their coordinates may be fractional, 
 * allowing smooth motion.
*/

/*
 * Levels
 * ------
 *
 * A human-readable, human-editable way to specify levels. Since it is okay for everything to start out 
 * on a grid, we could use big strings in which each character represents an element—either a part of 
 * the background grid or a moving element.
 *
 * Periods are empty space, hash (#) characters are walls, and plus signs are lava. The player’s starting 
 * position is the at sign (@). Every O character is a coin, and the equal sign (=) at the top is a block 
 * of lava that moves back and forth horizontally.
 *
 * The game will also support two additional kinds of moving lava: the pipe character (|) creates vertically 
 * moving blobs, and v indicates dripping lava—vertically moving lava that doesn’t bounce back and forth but 
 * only moves down, jumping back to its start position when it hits the floor.
 *
 * A whole game consists of multiple levels that the player must complete. A level is completed when all coins 
 * have been collected. If the player touches lava, the current level is restored to its starting position, 
 * and the player may try again.

/*
 * Reading A Level
 * ---------------
 *
 * The `level` class stores a level object. Its argument should be 
 * the string that defines the level.
 *
 * The `trim` method is used to remove whitespace at the start and end of 
 * the plan string. This allows our example plan to start with a newline so 
 * that all the lines are directly below each other. 
 * 
 * The remaining string is split on newline characters, and each line is spread 
 * into an array, producing arrays of characters.
 *
 * So `rows` holds an array of arrays of characters, the rows of the plan. 
 * We can derive the level’s width and height from the `rows` array.
 *
 * But we must still separate the moving elements from the background grid. 
 * We’ll call moving elements actors. They’ll be stored in an array of objects.
 * 
 * The background will be an array of arrays of strings, holding field types such as 
 * "empty", "wall", or "lava".
 *
 * To create these arrays, we map over the rows and then over their content. 
 * Remember that `map` passes the array index as a second argument to the mapping 
 * function, which tells us the x- and y-coordinates of a given character. 
 * 
 * Positions in the game will be stored as pairs of coordinates, with the top left 
 * being 0,0 and each background square being 1 unit high and wide.
 *
 * To interpret the characters in the plan, the `Level`` constructor uses the `levelChars` 
 * object, which maps background elements to strings and actor characters to classes.
 *
 * When `type` is an actor class, its static `create` method is used to create an object, 
 * which is added to `startActors`, and the mapping function returns "empty" for this 
 * background square.
 *
 * The position of the actor is stored as a `Vec` object. This is a two-dimensional vector, 
 * an object with `x` and `y` properties.
*/

class Level {
    constructor(plan) {
        let rows = plan.trim().split("\n").map(l => [...l]);
        this.height = rows.length;
        this.width = rows[0].length;

/*
 * As the game runs, actors will end up in different places or even disappear 
 * entirely (as coins do when collected).
 * 
 * We’ll use a `State` class to track the state of a running game. The 
 * `status` property will switch to "lost" or "won" when the game has ended.
 *
 * This is again a persistent data structure—updating the game state creates a 
 * new state and leaves the old one intact.

/*
 * Actors
 * ------
 *
 * Actor objects represent the current position and state of a given moving 
 * element in our game. All actor objects conform to the same interface.
 *
 * Their `pos` property holds the coordinates of the element's top-left corner,
 * and their `size` property holds its size.
 *
 * Then they have an `update` method, which is used to compute their new state
 * and position after a given time step. It simulates the thing the actor does
 * --moving in response to the arrow keys for the player and bouncing back and
 * forth for the lava--and returns a new, updated actor object.
 *
 * A `type` property contains a string that identifies the type of the actor--
 * "player", "coin", or "lava". This is useful when drawing the game--the look
 * of the rectangle drawn for an actor is based on its type.
 *
 * Actor classes have a static `create` method that is used by the `Level`
 * constructor to create an actor from the character in the level plan. It is
 * given the coordinates of the character and the character itself, which is 
 * needed because the `Lava` class handles several different characters.
 *
 * The different types of actors get their own classes since their behavior is
 * very different.
 */

/*
 * The `Vec` class is used for two-dimensional values, such as the position and
 * size of actors.

/*
 * Motion and Collision
 * --------------------
 *
 * The basic approach, taken by most games (like this), is to
 * split time into small steps and, for each step, move the actors by a distance
 * corresponding to their speed multiplied by the size of the time step.
 *
 * We'll measure time in seconds, so speeds are expressed in units per second.
 *
 * Moving things is easy. The difficult part is dealing with the interactions between
 * the elements.
 *
 * When the player hits a wall or floor, they should not simply move through it.
 * the game must notice when a given motion causes an object to hit another object and
 * respond accordingly.
 *
 * For walls, the motion must be stopped. When hitting a coin, it must be collected.
 * When touching lava, the game should be lost.
 *
 * Before moving the player or a block of lava, we test whether the motion would take it
 * inside of a wall. If it does, we simply cancel the motion altogether. The
 * response to such a collision depends on the type of actor--the player will stop,
 * whereas a lava block will bounce back.
 *
 * This approach requires our time steps to be rather small since it will cause
 * motion to stop before the objects actually touch. If the time steps (and thus
 * the motion steps) are too big, the player would end up hovering a noticeable
 * distance above the ground.
 */

/* 
 * This `touches` method tells us whether a rectangle (specified by a position and a size)

 *
 * The method computes the set of grid squares that the body overlaps with by using

 * 1 by 1 units in size. By rounding the sides of a box up and down, we get the range
 * of background squares that the box touches.
 *
 * We loop over the blocks of grid squares found by rounding the coordinates and
 * return `true` when a matching square is found. Squares outside of the level are always
 * treated as "wall" to ensure that the player can't leave the world and that we won't
 * accidentally try to read outside of the bounds of our `rows` array.

 * should not prevent horizontal motion, and hitting a wall should not stop
 * falling or jumping motion.
 *
 * The horizontal motion is computed based on the state of the left and right
 * arrow keys. When there's no wall blocking the new position created by this
 * motion, it is used. Otherwise, the old position is kept.
 *
 * Vertical motion works in a similar way but has to simulate jumping and 
 * gravity. The player's vertical speed (`ySpeed`) is first accelerated to
 * account for gravity.
 *
 * We check for walls again. If we don't any, the new position is used. If there
 * is a wall, there are two possible outcomes. When the up arrow is pressed and we
 * are moving down (meaning the thing we hit is below us), the speed is set to a
 * relatively large, negative value. This causes the player to jump. If that is not the
 * case, the player simply bumped into something, and the speed is set to zero.

/*
 * Tracking Keys
 * -------------
 *
 * For a game like this, we do not want keys to take effect once per
 * keypress. Rather, we want their effect (moving the player figure) to
 * stay active as long as they are held.
 *
 * We need to set up a key handler that stores the current state of the left,
 * right, and up arrow keys. We will also want to call `preventDefault` for
 * those keys so that they don't end up scrolling the page.
 *
 * The `trackKeys` function, when given an array of key names, will return an
 * object that tracks the current position of those keys. It registers event
 * handlers for "keydown" and "keyup" events and, when the key code in the event
 * is present in the set of codes that it is tracking updates the object.
 *
 * The same handler function is used for both event types. It looks at the
 * event object's `type` property to determine whether the key state should
 * be updated to true ("keydown") or false ("keyup").

/*
 * Running the Game
 * ----------------
 *
 * The `requestAnimationFrame`` function, provides a good way to animate a game. 
 * But its interface is quite primitive—using it requires us to track the time 
 * at which our function was called the last time around and call 
 * `requestAnimationFrame` again after every frame.
 */

/*
 * The `runAnimation` helper function wraps the boring parts in a convenient 
 * interface and allows us to simply call `runAnimation`, giving it a function
 * that expects a time difference as an argument and draws a single frame. When
 * the frame function returns the value `false`, the animation stops.
 *
 * We have set a maximum frame step of 100 milliseconds. When the browser tab or
 * window with our page is hidden, `requestAnimationFrame` calls will be suspended
 * until the tab or window is shown again.
 *
 * In this case, the difference between `lastTime` and `time` will be entire time in
 * which the page was hidden. Advancing the game by that much in a single step would
 * look silly and might cause weird side effects, such as the player falling through
 * the floor.
 *
 * Th function also converts the time steps to seconds, which are an easier quantity
 * to think about than milliseconds.
