<!-- Simple Vanilla JS multistep application form with validation and summary page. - https://github.com/arminas-a/multistep_application_form -->

<!-- I was given a task by a bank to create a simple application. Requirements were these:

  1. The form has an intro part, 5 questions, and a summary part.
  2. One question is visible at a time.
  3. All answers are mandatory. One moves to the next question only after answering the previous one.
  4. There is a possibility to move back to the previous question.
  5. All of the following elements are used: radio button, checkbox, drop-down box, textarea.
  6. A tooltip element is used at least once to explain one of the choices.
  7. The form has error messages.
  8. In the summary page all questions and answers are displayed. Data is not saved anywhere.
  9. No pre-made frameworks or templates are used.
  10. The final result is an archived file which opens a working application form.
